This project is a multi-step onboarding app built with React. It focuses on providing a smooth and clean user experience, allowing users to customize the theme and layout. The app is responsive, meaning it works well on both mobile and desktop screens, and it saves user preferences so theyâ€™re not lost when refreshing or returning later.

Key Features
Welcome Page: The starting point where users begin the onboarding process.

Three-step Onboarding: The app guides users through three stages:

Personal Details â€” collecting name and email.

Business Information â€” gathering company name, industry, and size.

Preferences â€” letting users choose their preferred theme and dashboard layout.

Theme Toggle: Users can switch between Light (with a sun icon ðŸŒž) and Dark mode (with a moon icon ðŸŒ™). The choice is saved so it stays the same next time they visit.

Dashboard Layout Options: Users can pick either a Grid view (icon ðŸ”²) or a List view (icon ðŸ“‹) for their dashboard.

Progress Tracking: Shows users which step theyâ€™re on:

On desktop, this appears as a sidebar.

On mobile, itâ€™s displayed as a horizontal bar at the top.

Form Validation: Users canâ€™t move forward unless they fill in the required fields correctly.

Responsive Design: The app automatically adjusts its layout to look great on different screen sizes.

State Persistence: All user choices â€” theme, layout, and form data â€” are saved in localStorage so theyâ€™re remembered across sessions.
